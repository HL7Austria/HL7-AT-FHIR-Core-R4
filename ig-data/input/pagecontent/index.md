HL7 Austria is an official Affiliate of HL7 International. Within HL7 Austria the technical committee for FHIR (TC FHIR) is responsible to promote and disseminate the new upcoming standard HL7 FHIR.
The TC FHIR deals with the standard-compliant and coordinated usage of HL7 FHIR based communication solutions. 
It coordinates and describes necessary localizations and offers concrete help for FHIR-compliant interfaces.
