In Austria, practitioners in healthcare are commonly called “Gesundheitsdienstleistungsanbieter (GDA)” (in English: Healthcare Service Provider). This German abbreviation is therefore used throughout this profile.
Austrian GDAs are usually identified with one or more of the following identifiers:
- The “GDA OID” which is maintained in the Austrian GDA-Index.
- A “Vertragspartnernummer (VPNR)“  which is an identifier provided by the Federation of Austrian Social Insurances.
- A “ Verschlüsseltes bereichsspezifisches Personenkennzeichen (vbPK)” which is an encrypted personal unique identifier used for practitioners.
